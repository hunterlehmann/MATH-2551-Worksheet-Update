\begin{enumerate}
	
	
	
	
	\item Suppose that $\br(t)$ satisfies 
	\[
	\br''(t)=-\bi-\bj-\bk, \quad t\geq 0, \qquad \br'(0)=5 \bi, \qquad \br(0)=10\bi+10\bj+10\bk
	\]
	Find $\br(t)$.
	
	\item A baseball is hit when it is $2.5$ ft above the ground. It leaves the bat with an initial velocity of $140$ ft/sec at a launch angle of $30^\circ$. At the instant the ball is hit, an instantaneous gust of wind blows against the ball, adding a component of $-14 \hat{i}$ (ft/sec) to the ball's initial velocity. A $15$ ft high fence lies $400$ ft from the home plate in the direction of the flight. (Note that gravity, g $= 32$ ft/sec$^2$)
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Include an appropriate sketch.
		
		\item Find a vector equation for the path of the baseball.
		
		\item How high does the baseball go, and when does it reach maximum height?
		
		\item Find the range and flight time of the baseball, assuming that the ball is not caught.
		
		\item When is the baseball $20$ ft high? How far (ground distance) is the baseball from home plate at that height?
		
		\item Has the batter hit a home run? Explain.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item $\br(t)=\langle -\dfrac{1}{2}t^2+5t+10,-\dfrac{1}{2}t^2+10,-\dfrac{1}{2}t^2+10\rangle, \quad t\geq 0$.
	\item A baseball is hit when it is $2.5$ ft above the ground. It leaves the bat with an initial velocity of $140$ ft/sec at a launch angle of $30^\circ$. At the instant the ball is hit, an instantaneous gust of wind blows against the ball, adding a component of $-14 \hat{i}$ (ft/sec) to the ball's initial velocity. A $15$ ft high fence lies $400$ ft from the home plate in the direction of the flight. (Note that gravity, g $= 32$ ft/sec$^2$)
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Sorry, no sketch. :)
		
		\item $\vect r(t) = (140\cos 30^\circ-14)t \hat{i}+ (2.5+(140\sin 30^\circ)t-16t^2)\hat{j} = (70\sqrt{3} -  14) t \hat{i} + (2.5+70t-16t^2) \hat{j}$.
		
		\item $y_{\text{max}}=\frac{(140 \sin 30^\circ)^2}{64}+2.5=\frac{70^{2}}{64}+2.5 = 79.0625$ ft., which is reached at $t = \frac{140 \sin 30^\circ}{32}=\frac{70}{32}=2.1875$ s.
		
		\item For the time, solve $y=2.5+70t-16t^2=0$ for $t$. Using quadratic formula, we have $t=4.41$s. Then, the range at $t=4.41$ is $x(4.41) = (140\cos 30^\circ-14)(4.41)=472.94$ ft. 
		
		\item For the time, solve $y=2.5+70t-16t^2=20$ for $t$. Using quadratic formula, we have $t=0.27, \ 4.11$ seconds. Then, the range at those times are $x(0.27) = 29$ ft and $x(4.11)=441$ ft.
		
		\item Yes, according to part (d), the ball is still 20 feet above the ground when it is 441 feet from home plate.
